                I was born at Jeddah in Saudi Arabia, and lived there for quite a while
                I then remember moving to Dammam when I was reaching close to 5 years of
                age and ever since, I had been living there. The climate there is extremely
                hot, reaching up to 50 degrees on an extremely hot day. Altough majority of 
                the people think Saudi Arabia as a full desert. Contrary to what many think, 
                Saudi Arabia is a very well-built country with strong economy and great
                infrastructure. The citizens being especially generous and understanding, 
                you can expect to make friends with the locals and might end up to their
                home for a hearty meal together filled with joyous laughters and a fulfilling 
                night. The picture on the top left was my recent visit to Makkah. Offering
                pilrimage is easily accessible to the people living on that country.
