            <h1>Tastes of Saudi Arabia</h1>

            <p>
                
                Bukhori and Shawarma are two traditional delights
                that hold a special place in the rich culinary 
                tapestry of Saudi Arabia. Bukhori, a fragrant 
                rice dish infused with aromatic spices, is a 
                testament to the kingdom's love for flavorful 
                and hearty meals. This dish often features tender 
                meat, such as lamb or chicken, adding a savory 
                dimension to the perfectly seasoned rice. On the 
                other hand, Shawarma, a popular street food, 
                showcases the influence of Middle Eastern cuisine 
                in Saudi Arabia. Thinly sliced marinated meat, 
                typically chicken or beef, is slow-cooked on a 
                vertical rotisserie, resulting in succulent layers 
                that are then wrapped in flatbread. The combination
                of spices and the unique cooking method imparts a 
                distinct taste to Shawarma, making it a beloved and
                easily recognizable dish across the country. 
                Together, Bukhori and Shawarma exemplify the 
                diverse and delicious offerings found in Saudi 
                Arabian culinary traditions. For those 
                planning to have a trip to Saudi, I recommend getting 
                the taste of Shawarma
                before leaving as it is currently my favourite street 
                food from Saudi Arabia.
