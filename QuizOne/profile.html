                Hi! My name is Hassan Mohammad Mahsun, you can call me by first name Hassan. I am an Indonesian, born and raised in 
                Saudi Arabia due to my parents job. I came to Indonesia to pursue my higher level of education at ITS and
                I am currently at my second
                year majoring in Informatics
                from the batch of 2022. In my free time, I tend to read Japanese comics, browsing through social media, keeping up
                with friends or watching TV shows while I eat. I try to keep my body healthy and fit by working-out 
                in my place of stay, and occasionally, I go to the gym for the complex equipments.
