            <h1> Tour Saudi Arabia</h1>

            <p>
                For people interested in having a tour around
                Saudi Arabia, I suggest the Ithra located my 
                hometown Al-Dammam. Though I haven't went there
                myself, my parents and siblings did while I was
                here in Indonesia, I could tell they had a great time from
                the pictures they sent to me. I
                 wasn't brought out a lot back then but would 
                 go to malls every Friday and would go to an 
                 area near the shore known as "Cornniche" beside
                 my hometown. Not only is it very accessible,
                 many locals prefer going to corniche to spend their
                 time with family. While the children run around and play
                 in the field or theh provided playground.
